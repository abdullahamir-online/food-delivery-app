# 🍔 Foodie - Food Delivery Web App

**Foodie** is a simple yet functional **Food Delivery Web Application** designed as a group project.  
The frontend was handed over to me, and I developed and integrated the **Node.js backend** to power the app with real functionalities like authentication and order management.
